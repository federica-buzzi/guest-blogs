We are a few weeks into 2021 and we have all realized that times have definitely changed. With the pandemic many jobs went partially or fully remote. Many are considering switching careers for something that can be done from home. If you are one of those people I recommend you look into web development.

## **What is Web Development?**

Web development involves the building and maintenance of websites. This can include a simple website such as a small coffee shopâ€™s site to extremely complex websites like Facebook and Twitter. To become a web developer all you need is a computer and good internet connection. 

## **Why Web Development?**

With web development as one of your skill sets you will be better placed in the job market and many more doors will open. You can even start your own business as a freelance web developer. The options are endless and with the ever-evolving tech industry there is no limit.

In this article I will share with you resources that **are completely free** and that you can use to start learning web development in 2021.

### 1. FreeCodeCamp

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a widely known website that is free and the perfect place to start your web development journey. It has planned out learning paths that you can follow and earn a certificate for once completed. Each certification includes projects that you complete at the end that help you practice and apply what you have learned. You can also use the projects as examples of your work when you apply to jobs. There is a great community behind FreeCodeCamp that you can interact with through their forum, social media, and even Youtube. 

### 2. SoloLearn

[SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) is a mobile app with very detailed courses on various topics. It is a great app for learning and practicing on the go. There is also a bookmark option where you can save sections of a course and keep them as a reference in your account. Each lesson has a comment section where you can see what others have said and you can connect with other people taking the same course.

### 3. Codecademy

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.dev) is one of the most popular websites to learn web   development. They have free and paid options. Similar to other platforms Codecademy also offers learning paths that you can follow to specialize in a certain area of web development. You can definitely take advantage of their free options and learn a lot. They also have a great community that you can join and use as a resource on your journey. 

### 4. W3Schools

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is my go-to reference. I always go back to it when I get stuck or have quick questions about HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. At the beginning of my journey I used it a lot to read up on the basics of CSS. You can also try out the code and see how it works. This website is great if you use it in combination with any of the other apps and websites mentioned here.

### **5. YouTube**

YouTube is not necessarily a course but there are many great tutorials that you can watch and learn a lot from. However, try not to get stuck in tutorial loops. Watch a video and start practicing what you learned. Make your own projects to ensure that the knowledge is sticking.

Here are a few YouTube accounts for you to check out:

All these resources are great starting points and can help you in becoming a web developer. However, practice is the best thing you can do to propel your progress and place yourself closer to success. After you complete a section within a course or video tutorial, I would 100% recommend that you make your own projects. It might seem a little bit scary but the important thing is to just get started.
